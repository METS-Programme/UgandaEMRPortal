== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with the theme that I am using? =

Our tests indicate that the widgets work well with most themes that are well coded. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword.

The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full width page template without sidebars. The widgets can still be used in the widgetized sidebars of pages of default template.

= How to enable the dark version for any widget? =

In SiteOrigin page builder, add a row wrapper for the widget, edit row and check the option 'Dark Background?' under 'Row Styles' &gt; Design.

If not using a page builder, you can wrap the widget with a div of class 'lsow-dark-bg' to invoke dark version. Make sure you set the appropriate dark background for the wrapper div.

= Seeing 'Missing Widget' error upon import. =

Please make sure the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin is installed/activated and enable the widgets from Plugins &gt; SiteOrigin Widgets in WordPress admin.

= My portfolio does not show any items. =

Pls install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-post-type/" title="Portfolio Post Type">Portfolio Post Type plugin</a> to enable custom post type Portfolio.
